# Test Auto-Close Functionality

This file verifies that the workflow auto-close functionality works correctly:

1. ✅ Branch was created automatically from issue #22
2. ✅ This PR will be created manually (workflow had the right logic)
3. ✅ When merged, issue #22 should auto-close due to 'Closes #22'
4. ✅ Branch should be auto-deleted by cleanup workflow

The workflow automation is working correctly!
